A MEDICAL NAME THAT REFERS TO INNOVATION
Medicevo is a focused brand name that needs little explanation. It is of course a merger of medic/medicine/medical with 'evo' - an abbreviation universally associated with evolution. So for a medical / pharma business wanting to communicate innovation and forward-looking positivity, Medicevo will be hard to beat.
